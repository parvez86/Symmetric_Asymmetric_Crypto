# Symmetric_Asymmetric_Crypto
A simple python project that can encrypt-decrypt any text using the symmetric cryptography AES and Asymmetric cryptography RSA. It can generate RSA hash, signature and verify RSA signature. It also shows the different execution times with the different types of keys of these two cryptographic.
